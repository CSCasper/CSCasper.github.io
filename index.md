This is my GitHub Learning Portfolio where I will present topics about furthering education.

I graduated from The Ohio State University in 2019 and worked in industry as a supplier for Honda for 3 years. After getting hands on experience, I've now transitioned to working in education at CSCC, furthering my skills as a IT Analyst and Project Manager.

My goal is to continue my education as a lifelong learner and encourage others to do so as well. I also enjoy reading and longboarding whenever I get the chance.

Below are some of my accomplishments being both a educator and student participating in our non-credit IT programs.
