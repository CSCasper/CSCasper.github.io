# Hello World!

![CSCC Banner](CSCC_Banner.png)

This is my GitHub learning portfolio where I will present topics about furthering education.

I graduated from The Ohio State University in 2019 and worked in industry as a supplier for Honda. After getting hands on experience, I've now transitioned to working in education at CSCC, furthering my skills as a IT analyst and project manager.

Learning in both in my work and freetime is a priority for me and my goal is to continue my education and encourage others to do so as well. I also enjoy reading and longboarding whenever I get the chance.
